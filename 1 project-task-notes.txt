These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Build an SQL Reference Object." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-git-by-building-an-sql-reference-object/build-an-sql-reference-object

About this guided project:
	- This is a 240-lesson guided project course 
	- The purpose of this project is to practice using Git 
	- We do this to keep track of the code 
	- We are creating an object containing commonly used SQL commands for this 

To complete the guided project:
	- Copy the project boilerplate code in a Gitpod environment 
	- Open the command palette (command, shift, p)
	- CodeRoad: Start
	- Complete the guided project 

Saving progress: 
	- You have to complete all of the project progress in one go (without backing out of Gitpod)
		- Otherwise your progress might not be saved -> in which case you would have to redo it
