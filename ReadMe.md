# Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my twelfth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-git-by-building-an-sql-reference-object/build-an-sql-reference-object) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my versioning skills with Git. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the twelfth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Creating an SQL Reference Object With Git 
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to create an SQL reference object by completing 240 Git lessons in a Gitpod environment. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). 

### Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 240 Git lessons
- An [SQL reference object](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/tree/main/sql_reference) was created for this, which held three primary files (README.md, sample.env and sql_reference.json) 
-  The [in-depth notes I produced when completing this task are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-sql-reference-object-project-course-notes.txt). These are annotated and include the Bash / Git commands which were run when creating this reference object 
- Since the project was run in a virtual machine and the aim of this was to practice Git / Bash commands, `git log` was run for its sample.env and sql_reference files. Running this for these two files showed the result of the Git lessons on these files' commit history. The output of these git logs were placed into two shell files, `git log sample.env.sh` and `git log sql_reference.json.sh` and comitted to this repository
