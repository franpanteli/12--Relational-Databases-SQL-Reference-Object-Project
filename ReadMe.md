# Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my twelfth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-git-by-building-an-sql-reference-object/build-an-sql-reference-object) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my versioning skills with Git. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the twelfth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Creating an SQL Reference Object With Git 
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to create an SQL reference object by completing 240 Git lessons in a Gitpod environment. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). 

### Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 240 Git lessons
- An SQL reference object was created for this [sql_reference](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/tree/main/sql_reference), which held three primary files (README.md, sample.env and sql_reference.json) 
-  The [in-depth notes I produced when completing this task are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/12--Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-sql-reference-object-project-course-notes.txt). These are annotated and include the Bash / Git commands which were run when creating this reference object 
- Since the project was run in a virtual machine and the aim of this was to practice Git / Bash commands, `git log` was run for its [sample.env](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/sql_reference/sample.env) and [sql_reference.json](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/sql_reference/sql_reference.json) files. Running this for these two files showed the result of the Git lessons on these files' commit history. The output of these git logs were placed into two shell files, [git log sample.env.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/git_logs/git%20log%20sample.env.sh) and [git log sql_reference.json.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-SQL-Reference-Object-Project/blob/main/git_logs/git%20log%20sql_reference.json.sh) and committed to this repository
